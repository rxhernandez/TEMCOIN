# TEMCOIN
Code base for Counting Origamis In Nanostructures in TEM Images

----------------

TEMCOIN provides benchmarking CNN models to predict ligation numbers in DNA origami nanostructures.

This repository includes the following content:
Training and validation datasets in folders: simulation/ and TEM/.
Testing unknown datasets in folders: predictVMD/ and predictTEM/.
The python3 codes are in the folder: DNA_origami_classification_MLAI/.
All the 10 different runs are in the folder: results_plots/ with the python code to do data analysis and plot.

Documentation
----------------

This repository contains code to implement TEMCOIN. It 
is a set of python scripts that runs namd in unix
enviroments.

* For details on the underlying theory and methods,
please refer to the following paper:
> DNA Origami Nanostructures Observed in Transmission Electron Microscopy Images can be Characterized through Convolutional Neural Networks (in preparation).
