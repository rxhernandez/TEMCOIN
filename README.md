# TEMCOIN
Code base for Counting Origamis In Nanostructures in TEM Images

----------------

TEMCOIN provides benchmarking CNN models to predict ligation numbers in DNA origami nanostructures.

This repository includes the following content:
Training and validation datasets in folders: simulation/ and TEM/.
Testing unknown datasets in folders: predictVMD/ and predictTEM/.
The python3 codes are in the folder: DNA_origami_classification_MLAI/.
All the 10 different runs are in the folder: results_plots/ with the python code to do data analysis and plot.

Details on the use and installation of the code is available in the [user_guide.md](https://github.com/rxhernandez/TEMCOIN/blob/main/user_guide.md).
